# AI Seer - Bug Bounty Agentic Workflow

## Project Description

AI Seer revolutionizes bug bounty programs by introducing an agentic workflow that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence to streamline and enhance the vulnerability discovery process.  Instead of relying solely on human researchers, AI Seer employs autonomous agents to proactively identify, analyze, and report potential security vulnerabilities, significantly improving the efficiency and effectiveness of bug bounty operations.

This project focuses on developing a system where AI agents:

* **Autonomously discover vulnerabilities:** Utilize various scanning and reconnaissance techniques to find potential weaknesses in target systems.
* **Prioritize and validate findings:** Analyze discovered vulnerabilities to assess their severity and potential impact, reducing false positives and focusing human efforts on critical issues.
* **Generate detailed reports:** Create comprehensive and well-structured reports for security teams, including proof-of-concept exploits and remediation recommendations.
* **Collaborate with human researchers:** Augment and assist human bug bounty hunters by providing them with valuable insights and automating time-consuming tasks.

## Key Features and Technologies

* **Autonomous Agents:** AI-powered agents capable of performing vulnerability scanning, analysis, and reporting without constant human intervention.
* **Vulnerability Analysis Engine:** A sophisticated engine that leverages machine learning to prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity, exploitability, and potential impact.
* **Automated Reporting Module:** A system that automatically generates detailed and standardized vulnerability reports, including proof-of-concept exploits.
* **Collaboration Platform:** A platform that facilitates seamless collaboration between AI agents and human researchers, enabling efficient knowledge sharing and vulnerability validation.

## Target Users

This project targets:

* Organizations running bug bounty programs
* Security teams seeking to improve the efficiency of their vulnerability management process
* Bug bounty hunters looking to leverage AI to enhance their research

## Vision

AI Seer aims to create a future where bug bounty programs are more efficient, effective, and scalable.
